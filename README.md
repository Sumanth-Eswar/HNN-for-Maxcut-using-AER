# HNN-for-Maxcut-using-AER
A fully digital solution for the NP-hard MaxCut problem using a Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) on FPGA. Integrated a FIFO-based Address Event Representation (AER) mechanism to enhance event-driven updates within the network. This approach demonstrates efficient parallel computation and energy-aware neural processing on hardware.
